# Myszo — Personal Website (Frontend)

This is a lightweight Vite + React frontend scaffold with Tailwind CSS (v4) for a sleek personal site.

Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Files of interest:

- `src/App.jsx` — main layout
- `src/components` — `Hero`, `About`, `Projects`, `Contact`, `Footer`

Next steps: replace placeholder text in components with your bio, project links, and images.

Notes

- Tailwind v4 uses a single import in `src/index.css` (`@import "tailwindcss";`), no config files are needed.
